I’m currently building my foundation in cybersecurity with a strong interest in understanding how systems can be protected from real-world threats.
I’ve always been curious about how technology works behind the scenes, and that curiosity naturally led me toward security.
I enjoy breaking down problems, analyzing logs, and figuring out where weaknesses might exist.

I value integrity, responsibility, and continuous improvement. To me, cybersecurity isn’t just about tools  it’s about protecting people and organizations from risks that can seriously impact their operations.
As I continue developing hands-on skills in areas like Linux, SQL, and security analysis, I aim to contribute to organizations by identifying vulnerabilities early, supporting secure systems,
and helping maintain trust in digital environments.
